# GESS_roadlane_detection
semester 7 project OUC Computer vision

**Road detection is one of the primary tasks for autonomous vehicles. However, it can be challenging to detect the road or the drivable region. In this work, we want to help correctly detect the lane line and navigating the vehicle as a key technology in unmanned driving for autonomous vehicles**

### to run our program:
  1. download the repository
  2. make sure you have *_opencv_* installed for python
  3. make sure that the video/image directory is correct
  4. execute the .py script
  5. the code for displaying images is commented out so that the video output is shown when running the code since it's more useful. if you want to see a step by step procedure with images then you comment the video output code and uncomment the display images code.
 
## to understand what we were doing in this work, read the final project report.md file which has all the steps taken and output results for each stage.

### to understand our motivation for road lane line detection, please read the file proposal.md

suggestions to our some of the problems identified in final report are welcome.
